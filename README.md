# Introduction

This is the backend service for an application where counsellors can set their availabilities whilst users can search through availabilities.

# Documentation

I chose to document the API by following the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#openapi-document). This is a new standard for me that I've tried to follow in my freelance work, as I've quickly come to learn the importance of good documentation.

For a simple API such as this, this was definitely overkill, but I've found it is good practice to design the API before implementing it.

# Database

I chose to use Postgres as the DBMS as most of my experience is with relational databases, and I knew this was a technology Spill worked with (even though the original format of the data makes me think it originated from a MongoDB database or other NoSQL DBMS).
